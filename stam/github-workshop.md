# GitHub as a Professional Software Development Platform
Software Development Studio  
Workshop 1 – GitHub Foundations

---

## Why This Workshop Exists

This course is not just about coding.

You will practice:
- Professional teamwork
- Industry-standard workflows
- Traceable decision-making
- Accountability and ownership

GitHub is the backbone of the entire course.

---

## Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, every team will:
- Understand how professional teams use GitHub
- Know the end-to-end development workflow
- Have a properly structured team repository
- Set up documentation, tasks, and project tracking

---

## What “Professional” Means in This Course

Course rules (non-negotiable):
- No task without a GitHub Issue
- No code without a Pull Request
- No merge without review
- No undocumented decisions

If it’s not in GitHub, it didn’t happen.

---

## GitHub Is More Than Code

GitHub replaces multiple tools:
- Documentation → Wiki / Markdown
- Task management → Issues
- Sprint planning → Projects
- Code review → Pull Requests
- Quality control → CI
- Accountability → History

One system. One source of truth.

---

## The Big Picture Development Workflow

Idea or Requirement  
↓  
GitHub Issue  
↓  
Feature Branch  
↓  
Pull Request  
↓  
Review + CI checks  
↓  
Merge to main

Every feature and fix follows this path.

---

## Why This Workflow Matters

This workflow provides:
- Traceability (who did what and why)
- Higher code quality
- Team visibility
- Easier onboarding
- Fair and transparent grading

This is how real software teams work.

---

## One Task – End-to-End Example

Example:
- Issue: “User can submit donation form”
- Branch: feature/donation-form
- Pull Request: links the Issue
- Review: comments and fixes
- Merge: Issue closes automatically

One clear story from idea to code.

---

## Team Roles and Visibility

GitHub makes contributions visible:

- Developers → commits and PRs
- Reviewers → review comments
- Scrum Masters → issues and milestones
- QA → bug reports and test PRs
- Product Liaison → issue descriptions

Visibility is intentional and graded.

---

## Repository Anatomy

Standard project structure:

- README.md
- /docs
- /frontend
- /backend
- /tests
- /.github

README is the project’s front door.  
Docs and Wiki contain specifications.

---

## The Wiki = Your Project Binder

Your Wiki must include:
- Vision and problem statement
- Stakeholders
- Requirements
- Architecture
- Sprint log
- Decisions and trade-offs

This replaces Word or PDF documents.

---

## Issues = Units of Work

A good Issue includes:
- Clear title
- Description
- Acceptance criteria
- Labels
- Assignee

If work is not in an Issue, it does not exist.

---

## Projects = Sprint Board

Project board columns:
- Backlog
- In Progress
- Review
- Done

Issues move across the board during the sprint.

---

## Today’s Hands-On Outcome

By the end of this session:
- Repository created
- Team members added
- Wiki initialized
- Project board created
- First Issue added

---

## Repository Naming Convention

Mandatory format:

np-<client>-<team>

Example:
np-foodbank-team3

No exceptions.

---

## Hands-On Setup (Team Activity)

You will now:
1. Create your repository
2. Add all team members
3. Enable Wiki and Projects
4. Initialize the Wiki using the template
5. Create your first Issue

Work as a team.

---

## First Required Issue

Issue title:
“Project setup and documentation initialization”

Checklist:
- Create folder structure
- Fill Wiki overview
- Add README sections
- Set up Project board

---

## Important Reminder

- GitHub activity is graded
- Individual contributions are visible
- Team success requires everyone to participate

---

## What Happens Next

Before next class:
- Complete Wiki sections
- Add at least 5 Issues
- Populate the Project board

Next session:
- Client discovery
- Requirements elicitation
- Sprint 0 planning

---
